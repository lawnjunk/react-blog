#### Howdy hackers!

I'm [**slugbyte**](https://github.com/slugbyte),

I teach Full-Stack JS development at a coding bootcamp. In my spare time I work on lots of dev projects. My interests include text editor design, programming language design, system automation, and audio synthesis. 

I plan to fill this site with some programming tutorial [gists](https://gist.github.com/slugbyte), a portfolio of some of my projects, an [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) tribute page, and _random_ things want to sharing with friends. 


**Happy Hacking Yall!**

_ps. I'm very dyslexic, and if you don't like my spelling I welcome pull requests. [fork this site](https://github.com/slugbyte/fire)_
